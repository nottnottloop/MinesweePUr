# MinesweePUr

MinesweePUr is a Minesweeper clone coded in C++ and SDL2.

Quite happy with this until the end where the code turns into spaghetti ;)

The PU originally was going to stand for powerups. Didn't really think powerups would be fun in the end. I might add a 'crazy mode' where the board moves erratically in the future.

**Controls:**

1, 2 and 3 to switch levels
R to restart

Alternatively you can do this by clicking on things, including a Windows XP Minesweeper inspired face to restart
