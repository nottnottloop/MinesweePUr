# MinesweePUr

**MinesweePUr** is a Minesweeper clone coded in C++ and SDL2. Features:
- 3 difficulty levels
- Persistent highscores
- [Kaboom](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxjGZo8oN5Y)

The PU originally was going to stand for powerups. Didn't really think powerups would be fun in the end. I might add a 'crazy mode' where the board moves erratically in the future.

The code is spaghetti, just like my Factorio bases ;)

**Controls:**

- 1, 2 and 3 to switch levels
- R to restart
- H for scoreboard
- C to change colors

Alternatively you can do this by clicking on things, including a Windows XP Minesweeper inspired face to restart
